<p style="font-size: 23px;">
  Making an <span style="color: #FF5722;font-weight: 700;">inference</span> is like being a detective. It means using clues from a story, passage, or situation, along with what you already know, to figure out something that is not directly stated. When you read, authors don't always tell you everything. Sometimes, they expect you to read between the lines and draw conclusions based on the information that is given.
  <br><br>
  <b>For example</b>, if a character in a story is shivering and looking at the sky, and you know that itâ€™s winter, you can infer that the character might be cold. 
<br>The clues are the characterâ€™s actions (shivering) and the weather (winter), and the conclusion you make is that the character is likely feeling cold.
<br><br>
Making inferences helps you understand stories and texts more deeply. It also improves your critical thinking skills because you're using evidence to make a thoughtful guess about something you don't know for sure.
</p>
<h3>Inference is a skill that can help you become a better reader, thinker, and problem solver.</h3>
